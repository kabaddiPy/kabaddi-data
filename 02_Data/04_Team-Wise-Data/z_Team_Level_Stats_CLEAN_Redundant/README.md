This contains data from the third tab in the [Tableu Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sports.kpi/viz/DEMO_PKL_S9/FrontPage?publish=yes%20).

<br><br>

This data is redundant as it has already been scraped from Prokabaddi.com. There were two stats that were worthwhile which was the division of `raid-points` into `touch points` and `bonus points`.

<br><br>

This data has been incorporated into the teams csv for the corresponding teams.

Hence, please ignore this data.
